I would propose the creation of a custom encrypted sqlite3 database that can be easily stored on a USB drive and accessible through excel file.

Classification categories for information:

All information within the group should be categorized as public, internal, confidential or extremely confidential.

Secure documents:

PII (personally identifiable information):

As the group continues regardless of the direction it takes unavoidably there will be identifiable information gathered about vulnerable individuals. Literacy on what falls under PII. I will aquire more verbose documentation and training material about this distinction.
 
Encryption:

ECC,an alternative technique to RSA, is a powerful cryptography approach. It generates security between key pairs for public key encryption by using the mathematics of elliptic curves.

Pycrytodome contains ECC encryption I can use. 

2FA as an additional security measure.

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an identity and access management security method that requires two forms of identification to access resources and data. 2FA gives businesses the ability to monitor and help safeguard their most vulnerable information and networks.
Benefits of 2FA

Businesses use 2FA to help protect their employees’ personal and business assets. This is important because it prevents cybercriminals from stealing, destroying, or accessing your internal data records for their own use.

The advantages of 2FA are endless. For example, with 2FA, there’s no need for users to carry or download a token generator, or an app associated with one. Most websites use your mobile device to text, call, or use a personalized 2FA for their business to verify your identity.

Some other advantages of 2FA include:

• There’s no need to use a hardware token generator. These types of 2FA methods are often lost or misplaced. However, with advanced technology, 2FA methods are more convenient than ever.
• Passcode generators are more efficient than traditional passwords. Generators are the safer option because no two passcodes are the same.
• Max passcode entry prevents cybercriminals from hacking and accessing sensitive data.
• The process is manageable and user-friendly.

Having two individuls with seperate passwords that combine to give access gives a reliable security fallback as both's approval for access is required and limits human error with simple deduction.
